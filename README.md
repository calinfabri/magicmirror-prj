I am trying to recreate the prj of MM

Hey guys,

I am a geodetic engineer that tries to learn to code and understand hardwre better.
The way i decided that i am going to approach this is trough the magic mirror project. :) Maybe not the easiest, but it sounds something that will keep me interested!
